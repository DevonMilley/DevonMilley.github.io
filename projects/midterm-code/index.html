            <h1>THE RISE OF</h1>
            <h1 class="adjust">HYPHENATED</h1>
            <h1>LAST NAMES IN PRO SPORTS</h1>
            <p class="bio">By Jan Diehm

            <p>I’m a big sports fan. My wife likes to joke that we’re one of the last millennial households in the country to have a cable subscription. The reason? Sports. Last winter I was watching an NFL game featuring one of the league’s most memorably named players: Ha Ha Clinton-Dix. But it wasn’t his first name that caught my attention—it was his last.</p>
            <p>The list of players whose names arch over the numbers on the back of their jerseys goes on and on: Clinton-Dix, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Sean Reid-Foley, JuJu Smith-Schuster, Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis. So I wanted to investigate: Are double-barrelled last names getting more common in professional sports? And what about overall?</p>
            <p>Turns out, hyphenated names are hard to study. Although athletes proudly wear their last names on their jerseys, most names are personal. The US Census collects last names, but to preserve the anonymity of individuals, only names appearing 100 or more times are released. So, you get names like Smith and Johnson, but never names like Smith-Johnson.</p>
            <p>Looking at just professional sports though, there’s a clear trend, especially for the four leagues (MLB, NBA, NFL, and NHL) that have been around since at least the 1950s.</p>
            <img src="images/graphic.png" class="img-fluid" alt="graphic of players with hyphenated last names">
            <p>Above, the players are grouped by the decade in which they entered each league. The NBA had its first hyphenated name in the 1960s, and the NFL followed in the 1970s with Herb Mul-Key, who changed his name because he was teased about it. “It used to be Mulkey, without the hyphen, but I had it changed lately because everybody used to make fun of it. They called me Mercury or Murky or Mushy or Musky, even one of my high school English teachers did that.”</p>
            <p>The NHL didn’t have a player with a hyphenated last name until the 1990s with Jean-Luc Grand-Pierre. The MLB was hyphen-less until Ryan Rowland-Smith’s debut in the 2000s.</p>
            <p>When the WNBA debuted in the 1990s, it rocked this male-only sports trend, largely because in the US it falls on women to change their last names after marriage. Laurie Scheuble, a Penn State professor who researches marital naming, said hyphens in the WNBA make sense: “These are women who have already established careers and they want to maintain their identity.” We can see this with stars like Skylar Diggins-Smith, who first rose to national prominence as Skylar Diggins during the 2010 NCAA women’s basketball tournament, and later changed her name after marriage.</p>

        <h2>BEHIND THE HYPHENS</h2>
        <p>Of course, there’s more to a hyphen than meets the eye. Players can (among other things):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>inherit double-barrelled names from their parents’ already hyphenated names like <a href="#">Ryan Rowland-Smith</a></li>
            <li>combine both of their parents’ last names like <a href="#">BenJarvus Green-Ellis</a> (39%
                percent of the players with hyphenated names fall into this category)</li>
            <li>get married and combine names with their spouse like <a href="#">Skylar Diggins-Smith</a></li>
            <li>change their name for religious reasons like <a href="#">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a></li>
            <li>and have culturally traditional hyphenated names like <a href="#">Jean-Luc Grand-Pierre</a></li>
        </ul>

    <div class="container">
            <p class="title-box">Rowland-Smith</p>

            <p class="description1">MLB</p>
            <p class="description2">Ryan Rowland-Smith</p>
            <p class="description3">Inherited already hyphenated name from parents</p>
            <p>The MLB didn’t have a player with a hyphenated last name until 2007, when Rowland-Smith took the
                mound for the Seattle Mariners, and the league’s only had three others since. Rowland-Smith,
                whose Twitter handle is @hyphen18, inherited his last name from his father, Rob Rowland-Smith,
                an Australian trainer known as “The Sandhill Warrior.” Rowland-Smith’s now a baseball analyst
                with his former team. He was again a part of MLB hyphen history when he called a Rangers’ game
                in May 2018 with both Isiah Kiner-Falefa and Austin Bibens-Dirkx in the lineup—the first time in
                MLB history that two starters sported hyphens.</p>
